    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tsp. unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 slices thin deli ham, chopped</li>
        <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>Pinch of black pepper</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded pepper jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 teaspoons of the butter in an 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the red and green bell pepper and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the ham, scallion, 1/8 teaspoon of the salt and a pinch of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the scallion is tender, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a plate; set aside. Wipe the skillet clean.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the eggs and the remaining 1\8 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. </li>
        <li>Return the skillet to medium heat. Melt the remaining 2 teaspoons of butter in the skillet, swirling to coat the bottom. Pour in the eggs. Swirl the pan and using a rubber spatula, push the set egg ribbons to the center of the skillet, allowing the liquid eggs to fill the edges of the skillet. Once a thin sheet of egg forms on the bottom of the skillet, top half of the egg sheet with the bell pepper mixture and the cheese. Fold the empty side of the egg sheet over the filling and remove from heat. Let the omelette continue cooking from residual heat until the cheese melts, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer the omelette to a serving plate and serve immediately.</li>
